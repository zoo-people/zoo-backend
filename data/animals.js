            in seedling establishment. They consume many different kinds of fungi, including those involved in symbiotic 
            mycorrhizal associations with trees, and are an important vector for dispersal of the spores of subterranean 
            sporocarps (truffles) which have co-evolved with these and other mycophagous mammals and thus lost the ability 
            to disperse their spores through the air.`,

    description: `The moose (in North America) or elk (in Eurasia) (Alces alces), is a member of the New World deer 
            subfamily and is the largest and heaviest extant species in the deer family. Most adult male moose have distinctive
            broad, palmate ("open-hand shaped") antlers; most other members of the deer family have antlers with a dendritic 
            ("twig-like") configuration. Moose are cold-adapted mammals with thickened skin, dense, heat-retaining coat, and a low surface:volume 
            ratio, which provides excellent cold tolerance but poor heat tolerance. Moose survive hot weather by accessing shade or cooling wind, 
            or by immersion in cool water. In hot weather, moose are often found wading or swimming in lakes or ponds.   Although generally slow-moving 
            and sedentary, moose can become aggressive, and move quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn features 
            energetic fights between males competing for a female.`,

    description: `Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical 
            adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour. It travels in nuclear families 
            consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and 
            in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality.
            Thewolf is also considered the ancestor of most domestic dog breeds. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded 
            attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from 
            people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.`,

    description: `The Northern flying squirrel is one of the smallest tree squirrels, measuring 10 to 12 inches in total length. It is nocturnal and has large eyes that are 
    extremely resourceful in the darkest nights. The color of eye shine is a distinctive reddish-orange. Flying squirrels are not capable of flight like birds or bats; instead, they glide between trees. They are able to glide from one tree to another 
    with the aid of a patagium, a furry, parachute-like membrane that stretches from wrist to ankle. In 2019 it was observed, by chance, that a flying squirrel fluoresced 
    pink. Subsequent research by biologists at Northland College in Northern Wisconsin found that this is true for all three species of North American flying squirrels. 
    At this time it is unknown what purpose this serves. Non-flying squirrels do not fluoresce under UV light.[`,
