    description: `The beaver is the largest semiaquatic rodent in North America. The beaver possesses 
        continuously (or endlessly) growing incisors. Beavers are active mainly at night. They are excellent 
        swimmers and may remain submerged up to 15 minutes. More vulnerable on land, they tend to remain in 
        the water as much as possible. They construct their homes, or "lodges", out of sticks, twigs, rocks, 
        and mud in lakes, streams, and tidal river deltas. The purpose of the dam is to create deepwater refugia 
        enabling the beaver to escape from predators. `,

        that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest 
        living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear`,

    description: `Chipmunks are small, striped rodents of the family Sciuridae. Chipmunks are found in North America, 
        with the exception of the Siberian chipmunk which is found primarily in Asia. These small mammals fulfill several 
        important functions in forest ecosystems. Their activities harvesting and hoarding tree seeds play a crucial role
        in seedling establishment. They consume many different kinds of fungi, including those involved in symbiotic 
        mycorrhizal associations with trees, and are an important vector for dispersal of the spores of subterranean 
        sporocarps (truffles) which have co-evolved with these and other mycophagous mammals and thus lost the ability 
        to disperse their spores through the air.`,

    description: `The moose (in North America) or elk (in Eurasia) (Alces alces), is a member of the New World deer 
        subfamily and is the largest and heaviest extant species in the deer family. Most adult male moose have distinctive
        broad, palmate ("open-hand shaped") antlers; most other members of the deer family have antlers with a dendritic 
        ("twig-like") configuration. Moose are cold-adapted mammals with thickened skin, dense, heat-retaining coat, and a low surface:volume 
        ratio, which provides excellent cold tolerance but poor heat tolerance. Moose survive hot weather by accessing shade or cooling wind, 
        or by immersion in cool water. In hot weather, moose are often found wading or swimming in lakes or ponds.   Although generally slow-moving 
        and sedentary, moose can become aggressive, and move quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn features 
        energetic fights between males competing for a female.`,

    icon_url: 'https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/4082/4082069.png',
    description: `Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical 
        adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour. It travels in nuclear families 
        consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and 
        in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality.
        Thewolf is also considered the ancestor of most domestic dog breeds. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded 
        attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from 
        people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.`,

    description: `The northern spotted owl is one of three spotted owl subspecies. It is a medium-sized dark brown owl native to the Pacific Northwest. 
    An important indicator species, the northern spotted owl remains threatened due to continued population decline from human-caused habitat destruction. 
    There are fewer than 6 individuals left in British Columbia, Canada; 1,200 pairs in Oregon, 560 pairs in Northern California, and 500 pairs in Washington. 
    Washington alone has lost over 90 percent of its old growth forest due to logging which has caused a 40-90 percent decline of the Northern Spotted Owl population. `,

    description: `The Northern flying squirrel is one of the smallest tree squirrels, measuring 10 to 12 inches in total length. It is nocturnal and has large eyes that are 
    extremely resourceful in the darkest nights. The color of eye shine is a distinctive reddish-orange. Flying squirrels are not capable of flight like birds or bats; instead, they glide between trees. They are able to glide from one tree to another 
    with the aid of a patagium, a furry, parachute-like membrane that stretches from wrist to ankle. In 2019 it was observed, by chance, that a flying squirrel fluoresced 
    pink. Subsequent research by biologists at Northland College in Northern Wisconsin found that this is true for all three species of North American flying squirrels. 
    At this time it is unknown what purpose this serves. Non-flying squirrels do not fluoresce under UV light.[`,
