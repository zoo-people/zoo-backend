        description: `The beaver is the largest semiaquatic rodent in North America. The beaver possesses 
        continuously (or endlessly) growing incisors. Beavers are active mainly at night. They are excellent 
        swimmers and may remain submerged up to 15 minutes. More vulnerable on land, they tend to remain in 
        the water as much as possible. They construct their homes, or "lodges", out of sticks, twigs, rocks, 
        and mud in lakes, streams, and tidal river deltas. The purpose of the dam is to create deepwater refugia 
        enabling the beaver to escape from predators. `,

        In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears, while the subspecies
        that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest 
        living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear`,

        description: `Chipmunks are small, striped rodents of the family Sciuridae. Chipmunks are found in North America, 
        with the exception of the Siberian chipmunk which is found primarily in Asia. These small mammals fulfill several 
        important functions in forest ecosystems. Their activities harvesting and hoarding tree seeds play a crucial role
        in seedling establishment. They consume many different kinds of fungi, including those involved in symbiotic 
        mycorrhizal associations with trees, and are an important vector for dispersal of the spores of subterranean 
        sporocarps (truffles) which have co-evolved with these and other mycophagous mammals and thus lost the ability 
        to disperse their spores through the air.`,

        description: `The moose (in North America) or elk (in Eurasia) (Alces alces), is a member of the New World deer 
        subfamily and is the largest and heaviest extant species in the deer family. Most adult male moose have distinctive
        broad, palmate ("open-hand shaped") antlers; most other members of the deer family have antlers with a dendritic 
        ("twig-like") configuration. Moose are cold-adapted mammals with thickened skin, dense, heat-retaining coat, and a low surface:volume 
        ratio, which provides excellent cold tolerance but poor heat tolerance. Moose survive hot weather by accessing shade or cooling wind, 
        or by immersion in cool water. In hot weather, moose are often found wading or swimming in lakes or ponds.   Although generally slow-moving 
        and sedentary, moose can become aggressive, and move quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn features 
        energetic fights between males competing for a female.`,

        description: `Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical 
        adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour. It travels in nuclear families 
        consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and 
        in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality.
        Thewolf is also considered the ancestor of most domestic dog breeds. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded 
        attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from 
        people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.`,
